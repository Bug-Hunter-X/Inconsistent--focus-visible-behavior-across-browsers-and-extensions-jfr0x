The following CSS code provides a potential solution by adding a fallback using the `:focus` pseudo-class to ensure consistent styling even if `:focus-visible` does not function correctly in all scenarios:

```css
.my-element:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid blue;
}

/* Fallback for cases where :focus-visible doesn't work as expected */
.my-element:focus {
  outline: 1px solid lightblue; /* Less prominent outline */
}
```

This approach applies a more subtle outline using `:focus` when `:focus-visible` might not be triggered. This ensures visual feedback remains for users while preserving a more subtle styling in cases where mouse clicks have brought an element into focus.
